From the architecture perspective, the system is divided into two parts - Bookstore and AdminPortal. Bookstore is the front-end website that customer will be using for submitting orders while AdminPortal is used for administration purpose. Presumably they will be running on two servers. The good side is the two apps are decoupled in some way so that they can be managed separately. The drawback would be that we need to maintain two copies of the code.

Technology Used: Technology Used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Java, Thymeleaf, Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate, MySQL.
